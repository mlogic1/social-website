lets use this txt to add / complete jobs that need doing

[mlogic1]22.10.2014
-create register.php with a form so a user can register (username, name, lastname, password, repeatpassword, e-mail)
-learn about mysql databases
-create mysql database where users are stored when registered, also figure out a way how to make users friends with each other (maybe even implement MD5 password hashing, but that later)
-fix hardcoded login screen to work with the database
-decide how the homepage will look for each user (social.php)
-decide how the profile page will look for each user (im thinking we do something like profile/username, like if i click your profile it will take me to social-website/profile/jakov)
-create a folder that each user has for images (probably need databases to do this)(where he uploads them and they are displayed on his profile)

26.10.2014
-added a register.php register form (POST action needs to be speicified in order to register the user to the DB (comment inside the php file)
-added images folder along with 2 seamless images from the interwebs (just placeholders)
-added a css file (loginregisterstyle.css) with some basic designs for registration and login form, found a cool round button template online
-removed plain text from login screen and used text inside the texboxes as hints instead. this is a new HTML5 feature called placeholder. this helped center the inputboxes.
-added registration link at the bottom of login form, as well as login link to the register page
