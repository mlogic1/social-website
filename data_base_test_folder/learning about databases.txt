open xampp, in there click Admin in the MySql row, it will take you to phpmyadmin
from there click databases and under database name write users (so we have the same name DB). Click Create.
On the left you will see the new database, click it. name the new table user with 4 colums. (firstname, lastname, password, username) no caps!
all are varchar(20). only password is varchar(64).

main code is still untouched

register.php is basically our copy that runs db.php script that registers new users.
